### Web scraping using python
Tested web scraping using python for a few sites.
I was just testing what sites can be scraped without needing to handle the AJAX request calls.
1. books.toscrape.com - extracted name and price for books in a dummy webpage selling books.
2. flipkart- scraped some product names, prices, user reviews from Flipkart for a few products.
3. github repo list AND selenium- lists github repos of an entered username and also has the ability of showing the github repositories webpage by automatically opening firefox and showing it to the user (if they want). Done by using selenium and geckodriver of firefox.
4. trip adviser- Nothing useful here , just checking whether Trip Adviser allows scraping on their website ( it does ).
